# 📚 Module 1: Questions and Answers

## Interview & Concept-Based Questions with Sample Answers

### Topic: Modern Data Ecosystem & Role of Data Engineer

1. **What is the primary role of a data engineer?**  
   → To design, build, and maintain data pipelines that ensure reliable, efficient, and scalable access to data.

2. **How does data engineering differ from data science?**  
   → Data engineers prepare and manage data infrastructure. Data scientists analyze the data and build models using it.

3. **Explain the components of the modern data ecosystem.**  
   → Sources (APIs, logs), Storage (DBs, Lakes), Processing (ETL/ELT), and Consumption (dashboards, ML).

4. **Who are the main players in the data ecosystem?**  
   → Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Analysts, ML Engineers, Business Analysts.

5. **Name 3 specializations in data engineering.**  
   → ETL Developer, Streaming Engineer, Cloud Data Engineer.

6. **What is the difference between ETL and ELT?**  
   → ETL: Transform before loading into the DB. ELT: Load raw data first, transform later inside the DB system.

7. **How has data engineering evolved over the last decade?**  
   → From RDBMS → Hadoop (batch) → Spark, Kafka (real-time) → Cloud-native tools (Snowflake, Airflow, DBT).

8. **Example of batch vs stream processing?**  
   → Batch: Monthly billing.  
     Stream: Real-time stock price updates.

9. **Common tools for processing?**  
   → Kafka (streaming), Apache Spark (batch), Airflow (orchestration), DBT (transformation).

10. **What does a typical pipeline look like?**  
   → Source → Ingestion → Transformation → Storage → Consumption

### Topic: Responsibilities & Skillsets of a Data Engineer

11. **What are key responsibilities of a data engineer?**  
    → Build pipelines, automate ingestion, clean/transform data, maintain infrastructure.

12. **List 5 technical skills for data engineering.**  
    → SQL, Python, Apache Spark, Airflow, Cloud Platforms (AWS/GCP/IBM)

13. **Important soft skills?**  
    → Clear communication, system thinking, debugging, documentation.

14. **Describe a day in the life of a DE.**  
    → Monitor jobs, fix failures, write scripts, sync with DS/DA teams, document work.

15. **How do you handle a failed job?**  
    → Check logs, rerun manually or auto-recover, fix root cause, update monitoring alerts.

16. **Why is data quality important?**  
    → Poor data leads to incorrect decisions, faulty analytics, or model failures.

17. **Tools for orchestration?**  
    → Apache Airflow, Prefect, Luigi

18. **Role of cloud in DE?**  
    → Provides scalable compute, managed storage (S3, BigQuery), and serverless processing.

19. **Ensuring scalability and reliability?**  
    → Use distributed tools (Spark), monitor pipelines, use retries/failover strategies.
